A video plugin for Wordpress built on the VideoJS HTML5 video player. This plugin features professionally oriented features including the integration of a maintenence panel, mobile device detection, and Google Analytics support. Much of this plugin is heavily based on and borrows code from the original VideoJS HTML5 Player for Wordpress plugin by Steve Heffernan, http://steveheffernan.com.

== Description ==

<p>  VideoJS Pro is a plugin for Wordpress that provides an easy to use interface for <a href = "http://www.videojs.com/" target = "_blank">VideoJS</a>, developed by <a href = "http://www.steveheffernan.com/" target = "_blank">Steve Heffernan</a>.<br />
  VideoJS is an HTML5 Video Player with 3 core parts: An embed code (<a href = "http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody" target = "_blank">Video for Everybody</a>), a Javascript library (video.js), and a pure HTML/CSS skin (video-js.css).<br />
  Using Video for Everybody as the embed code means you know itâ€™s compatible with many devices (including ones without javascript).  The javascript library fixes browser & device bugs, and makes sure your video is even more compatible across different browser versions.<br />
  The pure HTML5/CSS skin ensures a consistent look between HTML5 browsers, and easy custom skinning if you want to give it a specific look, or brand it with your own colors. See the skins page for examples of custom skins.<br />
